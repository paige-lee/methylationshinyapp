## Overview
To develop an R Shiny app for to facilitate the visualization and comparitive analysis of DNA methylation data obtained from Next Generation Sequencing of ERRBS and RRBS assays.

- Percentage overlap of CpG sites across ERRBS and RRBS experiments (definition, visualization, code)
- Data analysis steps - aggregate datasets (ERRBS, RRBS); Filter data (for 10x); Code visualization plots in R; Document here

## Roadmap
- Research Shiny apps and Github.
- Research the difference between ERRBS and RRBS methylation data.
- Describe the data for this project and define scientific objectives comparing and for visualizing this data.
- Create a Shiny app for interactive visual comparison of the data.
