### Venn diagram overlap plot for CG units covered ≥10x in ≥90% of RRBS and ERRBS samples
```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(ggVennDiagram)
load("rrbs_90.rda")
load("errbs_90.rda")
rrbs90 <- as.list(rrbs_90$Site)
errbs90 <- as.list(errbs_90$Site)
x <- list(RRBS=rrbs90, ERRBS=errbs90)
ggVennDiagram(x, color = "black") 
```

### Upset overlap plot for CG units covered ≥10x in ≥90% of RRBS and ERRBS samples
```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(UpSetR)
x <- list(RRBS=rrbs90, ERRBS=errbs90)
upset(fromList(x), sets.bar.color = c("blue","pink"), main.bar.color = c("blue", "pink", "gray"), set_size.show = TRUE, 
      set_size.scale_max= 4e+06)
```
